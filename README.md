# Heart_Disease_Predictor
This GitHub repository contains a project titled "Heart_Disease_Predictor". The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various input features. The repository includes the following files and directories:

1. `Predict.py`: A Python script that likely contains the code for loading the trained model and making predictions.
2. `Heart_Disease_Predictor (1).h5`: A file containing the trained machine learning model in the HDF5 format.
3. `scaler (3).pkl`: A pickle file that likely contains a pre-trained scaler object used for data preprocessing.
4. `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the required Python packages and dependencies for the project.
5. `.streamlit`: A directory that may contain configuration files or code related to the Streamlit web application framework, potentially used for creating a user interface for the prediction model.
6. `LICENSE`: A file containing the licensing information for the project.
7. `README.md`: A markdown file that typically provides an overview, instructions, and other relevant information about the project.

The repository does not have a detailed description, website, or topics provided. It is a public repository with one star and one watcher, but no forks or releases at the time of analysis.
